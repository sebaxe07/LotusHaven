\section{Work Breakdown}

Throughout the project, we aimed to maintain a balanced and collaborative workflow, ensuring that each team member could contribute and learn from different aspects of the development process. As the project progressed, we naturally divided responsibilities to leverage individual strengths and improve efficiency. Sebastian Perea and Daniel Ruiz primarily focused on the core development and implementation of the application, while Zeynep Erbaysal and Giacomo Scampini concentrated on the websiteâ€™s styling and user interface design. Despite this division, all members participated in discussions and contributed ideas to both the technical and design components, resulting in a cohesive and well-rounded final product.
